# Algorithms in DFS Animation Graphs

This repository contains the Python implementation - Graph Algorithms

## Description

The work consists of implementing an algorithm that loads information from a directed graph from a text file, following a pattern seen in the classroom. Then, the algorithm must execute the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on the loaded graph, according to the following specifications:

1. The graph can be stored in any data structure, using alphabetical/numeric precedence to organize the information.
2. DFS should start searching for the vertex that has the highest outdegree. If it is necessary to restart DFS, the vertex with the second highest out-degree must be chosen, and so on.
3. In response, the algorithm must print on the screen the values of the vectors 'd' and 'f' and the nomenclature of all edges (Tree Edge, Return Edge, Forward Edge or Crossing Edge) of the graph loaded with according to the DFS executed.
4. Additional: graphical interface simulating the algorithm steps in color
